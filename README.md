This is the repository for code snippets related to the BSc Project: Estimating Control Landscapes with Neural Networks.

Authors: Susan Chen and Katie Xiao

The code files include modifications that were made to the original Gaussian Models Code written by Charles Kerwin and Maddy Hughes for the purpose of our work as well as additional files that were written to quantify results related to the model performance.
